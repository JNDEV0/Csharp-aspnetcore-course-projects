/*
  Key value pairs added in json format to this document will be within the
  default app.Configuration collection, which can be injected to Controller
  and service constructors and accessed within them
  the keys can be directly added or as nested objects of KVPs


  a note about the appsettings.json hierarchy, values are first loaded from here
  and any KVPs with the same name in appsettings.Development.json will OVERRIDE the ones retrieved
  IF the environment in launchSettings.json are set to "Development", if it is something else like "Staging"
  for example, the KVPs retrieved will have values from appsettings.json, since there is no appsettings.Staging.json

  so KVPs with the same KEY can have different values condicional to the current ENVIRONMENT
